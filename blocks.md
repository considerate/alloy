The fundamental unit of RT code is the block.
Blocks are expressions, consisting of a scoped group of statements.

The RT variables in a block can be
  1. local declarations
  2. function arguments
  3. splice arguments
Do we want some sort of correspondence between 1 and 2?
For example, a block has to do its declarations upfront, some of which are runtime args?
